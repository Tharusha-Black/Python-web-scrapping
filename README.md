Handling and Manipulating Strings in the CSV File:
We will use Python's built-in csv module to read the CSV file and extract data as strings.
We'll use string manipulation methods like split, rstrip, and strip to process individual fields as needed.
Structuring Classes and Class Relationships:

We will have a Forecast class to represent each forecast entry.
Additionally, we'll have a ForecastCollection class to store all forecast objects.
We'll use a DataAnalyzer class to perform basic data analysis.
For reading data from the CSV file, we can have a separate CSVReader class.
Finally, we'll have a Main class to serve as the entry point and orchestrate the overall program flow.
Attributes and Data Types for Each Class:

The Forecast class will have attributes representing each field in the CSV file, with appropriate data types (e.g., str, datetime, int).
The ForecastCollection class will contain a list of Forecast objects.
The DataAnalyzer class will have methods to perform data analysis, returning sets or other appropriate data structures.
The CSVReader class will have a method to read data from the CSV file and return a ForecastCollection object.
Securing and Validating Data:

We will ensure data integrity by properly parsing and validating each field during object creation in the Forecast class.
For example, we'll use exception handling to catch and handle errors during data conversion (e.g., converting string to integer).
We may also implement additional validation logic based on specific requirements (e.g., validating temperature ranges, checking for missing fields).
Handling Potential Errors:

We'll use try-except blocks to handle potential errors during file reading, data conversion, or any other operations that may raise exceptions.
Error messages can be logged or displayed to the user to provide feedback on what went wrong.
We'll strive to make the program robust by anticipating potential errors and handling them gracefully.
